A-D buttons to regulate speed along X axis
W-S buttons don't do anything, but bring moral support :)
SPACEBAR to jump
jump is holdable, if you want a short jump - press for short time
Walls can be grabbed and jumped from.
Wall grabbing stops if input in opposite-from-wall input is registered,
so don't try to wall-jump-left, you'll fail it, just jump, let go off directionals, hit a wall, press jump again.
