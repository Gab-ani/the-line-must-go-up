A-D buttons to regulate speed along X axis
W-S buttons don't do anything, but bring moral support :)
SPACEBAR to jump
jump is holdable, if you want a short jump - press for short time
Walls can be grabbed and jumped from.
Wall grabbing stops if input in opposite-from-wall direction is registered,
so don't try to wall-jump-left while you fly, you'll fail it, just jump, let go off directionals, hit a wall, press jump again.
Map borders teleport you as in the Snake game.

Touching a ghost loses you a game.
Best tactic to drop the ghost from your tail is to traverse a border.

You can adjust difficulty, the lowest one, parkour, doesn't have ghosts.
